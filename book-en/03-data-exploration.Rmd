# Exploring the dataset

We will use two main data sets in the first part of this workshop.
"DoubsSpe.csv" is a data frame of fish community data where the first
column contains site names from 1 to 30 and the remaining columns are
fish taxa. The taxa columns are populated by fish abundance data
(counts). "DoubsEnv.csv" is a data frame of environmental data for the
same sites contained in the fish community data frame. Again, the first
column contains site names from 1 to 30. The remaining columns contain
measurements for 11 abiotic variables. Note that data used in ordination
analyses is generally in
[wide-format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Species community data frame (fish abundance): “DoubsSpe.csv”
spe<- read.csv(file.choose(), row.names=1)
spe<- spe[-8,] #Site number 8 contains no species and so row 8 (site 8) is removed. Be careful to
#only run this command line once as you are overwriting "spe" each time. 

#Environmental data frame: “DoubsEnv.csv”
env<- read.csv(file.choose(), row.names=1)
env<- env[-8,] #Remove corresponding abiotic data for site 8 (since removed from fish data). 
#Again, be careful to only run the last line once. 
```

## Species data

We can use summary functions to explore the "spe" data (fish community
data) and discover things like the dimensions of the matrix, column
headings and summary statistics for the columns. This is a review from
===== Workshop 2.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
names(spe) #see names of columns in spe
dim(spe) #dimensions of spe; number of columns and rows 
str(spe) #displays internal structure of objects
head(spe) #first few rows of the data frame
summary(spe) #summary statistics for each column; min value, median value, max value, mean value etc.  
```

Look at the species' distribution frequencies.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Species distribution
(ab <- table(unlist(spe))) #note that when you put an entire line of code in brackets like this, the output for that operation is displayed right away in the R console

barplot(ab, las=1, xlab="Abundance class", ylab="Frequency", col=grey(5:0/5))
```

![](/spe_barplot.png){width="300"} Can see that there is a high
frequency of zeros in the abundance data.

See how many absences there are in the fish community data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sum(spe==0) 
```

Look at the proportion of zeros in the fish community data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sum(spe==0)/(nrow(spe)*ncol(spe))
```

The proportion of zeros in the dataset is \~0.5.

See the frequency at which different numbers of species occur together.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
spe.pres <- colSums(spe>0) #compute the number of sites where each species is present. 
hist(spe.pres, main="Species occurrence", las=1, xlab="Frequency of occurrences", breaks=seq(0,30, by=5), col="grey")
```

Can see that an intermediate number of sites contain the highest number
of species.

Calculate the number of species that occur at each site. This is a
simplistic way of calculating species richness for each site. In some
cases, the number of individuals found in a site may differ between
sites. Because there may be a relationship between the number of
individuals counted in a site or sample and the taxa or species
richness, [rarefied species
richness](http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/diversity.html)
may be a more appropriate metric than total richness. The rarefy()
function in vegan can be used to generate rarefied species richness.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
site.pres <- rowSums(spe>0) #number of species with a value greater than 0 in that site row
hist(site.pres, main="Species richness", las=1, xlab="Frequency of sites", ylab="Number of species", breaks=seq(0,30, by=5), col="grey") 
```

## Environmental data

Explore the environmental data and create a panel of plots to compare
collinearity:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
names(env)
dim(env)
str(env)
head(env)
summary(env)
pairs(env, main="Bivariate Plots of the Environmental Data" ) 
```

In this case, the environmental data (explanatory variables) are all in
different units and need to be standardized prior to computing distance
measures to perform most ordination analyses. Standardize the
environmental data (11 variables) using the function decostand() in
vegan.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
env.z <- decostand(env, method="standardize")
apply(env.z, 2, mean) # the data are now centered (means~0)
apply(env.z, 2, sd)   # the data are now scaled (standard deviations=1)
```
