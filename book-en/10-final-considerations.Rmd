# Summary

Ordination is a powerful statistical tecnhique for studying the
relationships of objects characterized by several descriptors (e.g.
sites described by biotic communities, or environmental variables), but
serveral ordination methods exist. These methods mainly differ in the
type of distance preserved, the type of variables allowed and the
dimensions of the ordination space. To better guide your choice of the
ordination method to use, the following table identify the main
characteristics of the four ordination methods presented :

In the next workshop, you will see how to identify the relationships
between biotic communities and sets of environmental variables
describing the same sites, using canonical analyses.
