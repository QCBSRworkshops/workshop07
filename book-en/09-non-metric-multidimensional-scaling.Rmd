# Nonmetric MultiDimensional Scaling

The unconstrained ordination methods presented above allow to organize
objects (e.g. sites) characterized by descriptors (e.g. species) in
full-dimensional space. In other words, PCA, CA and PCoA computes a
large number of ordination axes (proportional to the number of
descriptors) representing the variation of descriptors among sites and
preserve distance among objects (the Euclidean distances in PCA, the
Chi2 distances in CA and the type of distances defined by the user in
PCoA). Users can then select the axis of interest (generally the first
two ones as the explained the larger part of the variation) to represent
objects in an ordination plot. The produced biplot thus represents well
the distance among objects (e.g. the between-sites similarity), but
fails to represent the whole variation dimensions of the ordination
space (as Axis3, Axis4,..., Axisn are not represented on the biplot, but
still contribute to explain the variation among objects).

In some case, the priority is not to preserve the exact distances among
sites, but rather to represent as accurately as possible the
relationships among objects in a small and number of axes (generally two
or three) specified by the user. In such cases, nonmetric
multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is the solution. If two axes are
selected, the biplot produced from NMDS is the better 2D graphical
representation of between-objects similarity: dissimilar objects are far
apart in the ordination space and similar objects close to one another.
Moreover, NMDS allows users to choose the distance measure applied to
calculate the ordination.

To find the best representation of objects, NMDS applies an iterative
procedure that tries to position the objects in the requested number of
dimensions in such a way as to minimize a stress function (scaled from 0
to 1) which measure the goodness-of-fit of the distance adjustment in
the reduced-space configuration. Consequently, the lower the stress
value, the better the representation of objects in the ordination-space
is. An additional way to assess the appropriateness of an NDMS is to
construct a Shepard diagram which plot distances among objects in the
ordination plot against the original distances. The R2 obtained from the
regression between these two distances measure the goodness-of-fit of
the NMDS ordination.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Run the NMDS
spe.nmds<-metaMDS(spe, distance='bray', k=2)
 
### Extract the results
spe.nmds

### Assess the goodness of fit and draw a Shepard plot
spe.nmds$stress
stressplot(spe.nmds, main='Shepard plot')

# Construct the biplot
windows()
plot(spe.nmds, type="none", main=paste('NMDS/Bray - Stress=', round(spe.nmds$stress, 3)),
     xlab=c("NMDS1"),
     ylab=c("NMDS2"))
points(scores(spe.nmds, display="sites", choices=c(1,2)),
       pch=21, col="black", bg="steelblue", cex=1.2)
text(scores(spe.nmds, display="species", choices=c(1)),
     scores(spe.nmds, display="species", choices=c(2)),
     labels=rownames(scores(spe.nmds, display="species")),
     col="red", cex=0.8)
```

The Shepard plot identifies a strong correlation between observed
dissimilarity and ordination distance (R2 \> 0.95), highlighting a high
goodness-of-fit of the NMDS.

![](/nmds_biplot.png){.align-center}

The biplot of the NMDS shows a group of closed sites characterized by
the species BLA, TRU, VAI, LOC, CHA and OMB, while the other species
form a cluster of sites in the upper right part of the graph. Four sites
in the lower part of the graph are strongly different from the others.

**Challenge 6** Run the NMDS of the mite species abundances in 2
dimensions based on a Bray-Curtis distance. Assess the goodness-of-fit
of the ordination and interpret the biplot.

**Challenge 6 - Solution** \<hidden\> Your code likely looks something
like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mite.spe.nmds<-metaMDS(mite.spe, distance='bray', k=2)
### Extract the results
mite.spe.nmds

### Assess the goodness of fit
mite.spe.nmds$stress
stressplot(mite.spe.nmds, main='Shepard plot')

### Construct the biplot
windows()
plot(mite.spe.nmds, type="none", main=paste('NMDS/Bray - Stress=', round(mite.spe.nmds$stress, 3)),
     xlab=c("NMDS1"),
     ylab=c("NMDS2"))
points(scores(mite.spe.nmds, display="sites", choices=c(1,2)),
       pch=21, col="black", bg="steelblue", cex=1.2)
text(scores(mite.spe.nmds, display="species", choices=c(1)),
     scores(mite.spe.nmds, display="species", choices=c(2)),
     labels=rownames(scores(mite.spe.nmds, display="species")),
     col="red", cex=0.8)
```

And your plots like this:

![](/nmds_mite_shepard.png){.align-center}

The correlation between observed dissimilarity and ordination distance
(R2 \> 0.91) and the stress value relatively low, showing together a
good accuracy of the NMDS ordination.

![](/nmds_mite_biplot.png){.align-center}

No cluster of sites can be precisely defined from the NMDS biplot
showing that most of the species occurred in most of the sites, i.e. a
few sites shelter specific communities. \</hidden\>
