# (PART\*) Linear mixed models (LMM) in `R` {-}


# Learning objectives

Mixed effects models allow ecologists to overcome a number of limitations associated with traditional linear models.

In this workshop, you will learn when it is important to use a **mixed effects model** to analyze your data. Specifically, we will:

**1.** Describe what are (generalized) mixed effects models

**2.** Identify situations in which the use of mixed effects is appropriate

**3.** Implement basic linear mixed models (LMM) with `R`

**4.** Execute basic generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with `R`

**5.** Validate, interpret and visualize mixed models with `R`

To prepare for this workshop, download and install the earliest RStudio and R versions. You should also download the data and some additional functions that we will use during this workshop:

-    [R Script](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop07/book-en/workshop07-script-en.R)
-    [Fish data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop07/main/book-en/data/qcbs_w7_data.csv)
-    [Arabidopsis data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop07/main/book-en/data/banta_totalfruits.csv)
-    [Inverts data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop07/main/book-en/data/inverts.csv)
-    [glmm_funs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop07/main/book-fr/data/glmm_funs.R) (code for use in the GLMM section)

You can save these files by clicking on the links above, and right click + save on the webpage they open.

This workshop requires the following `R` packages:
