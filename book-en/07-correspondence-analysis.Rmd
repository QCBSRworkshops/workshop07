# Correspondence Analysis

One of the key assumptions made in PCA is that species are related to
each other linearly and that they respond linearly to ecological
gradients. This is not necessarily the case with a lot of ecological
data (e.g. many species have unimodal species distributions). Using PCA
on data with unimodal species distributions or a lot of zero values may
lead to a phenomenon called the "horseshoe effect", and can occur with
long ecological gradients. As such, a CA or Correspondence Analysis may
be a better option for this type of data, see Legendre and Legendre
(2012) for further information. As CA preserves Chi2 distances (while
PCA preserves Euclidean distances), this technique is indeed better
suited to ordinate datasets containing unimodal species distributions,
and has, for a long time, been one of the favourite tools for the
analysis of species presence--absence or abundance data. In CA, the raw
data are first transformed into a matrix Q of cell-by-cell contributions
to the Pearson Chi2 statistic, and the resulting table is submitted to a
singular value decomposition to compute its eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. The result is an ordination, where it is the Chi2 distance
that is preserved among sites instead of the Euclidean distance in PCA.
The Chi2 distance is not influenced by the double zeros. Therefore, CA
is a method adapted to the analysis of species abundance data without
pre-transformation. Contrary to PCA, CA can also be applied to analyze
both quantitative and binary data (such as species abundances or
absence/presence). As in PCA, the Kaiser-Guttman criterion can be
applied to determine the significant axes of a CA, and ordination axes
can be extracted to be used in multiples regressions.

Run a CA on species data:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Run the CA using the cca() function (NB: cca() is used for both CA and CCA)
spe.ca <- cca(spe)
 
# Identify the significant axes
ev<-spe.ca$CA$eig
ev[ev>mean(ev)]
n=length(ev)
barplot(ev, main="Eigenvalues", col="grey", las=2)
abline(h=mean(ev), col="red")
legend("topright", "Average eigenvalue", lwd=1, col=2, bty="n")
```

From this barplot, you can see that once you reach C6, the proportion of
variance explained falls below the average proportion explained by the
other components. If you take another look at the CA summary, you will
notice that by the time you reach CA5, the cumulative proportion of
variance explained by the principal components is 84.63%.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
summary(spe.h.pca) #overall results
summary(spe.h.pca, diplay=NULL)# only axis eigenvalues and contribution
```

CA results are presented in a similar manner as PCA results. You can see
here that CA1 explains 51.50% of the variation in species abundances,
while CA2 explain 12.37% of the variation.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#### scaling 1
plot(spe.ca, scaling=1, type="none", main='CA - biplot scaling 1', xlab=c("CA1 (%)", round((spe.ca$CA$eig[1]/sum(spe.ca$CA$eig))*100,2)),
ylab=c("CA2 (%)", round((spe.ca$CA$eig[2]/sum(spe.ca$CA$eig))*100,2)))

     scores(spe.ca, display="species", choices=c(2), scaling=1),
     labels=rownames(scores(spe.ca, display="species", scaling=1)),col="red", cex=0.8)

#### scaling 2

     scores(spe.ca, display="species", choices=c(2), scaling=2),
     labels=rownames(scores(spe.ca, display="species", scaling=2)),col="red", cex=0.8)
```

These biplots show that a group of sites located in the left part with
similar fish community characterized by numerous species such as GAR,
TAN, PER, ROT, PSO and CAR; in the upper right corner, an other site
cluster characterized by the species LOC, VAI and TRU is identified; the
last site cluster in the lower right corner of the biplot is
characterized by the species BLA, CHA and OMB.

**Challenge 4** Run a CA of the "mite" species abundance data. What are
the significant axes of variation? Which groups of sites can you
identify? Which species are related to each group of sites?

**Challenge 4 - Solution** \<hidden\> Your code likely looks something
like the following:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# CA on mite species 
mite.spe.ca<-cca(mite.spe)

#What are the significant axes ?  
ev<-mite.spe.ca$CA$eig
ev[ev>mean(ev)]
n=length(ev)
barplot(ev, main="Eigenvalues", col="grey", las=2)
abline(h=mean(ev), col="red")
legend("topright", "Average eigenvalue", lwd=1, col=2, bty="n")

#Output summary/results  
summary(mite.spe.ca, display=NULL)

#Plot the biplot
windows()
plot(mite.spe.ca, scaling=1, type="none",
     xlab=c("PC1 (%)", round((mite.spe.ca$CA$eig[1]/sum(mite.spe.ca$CA$eig))*100,2)),
     ylab=c("PC2 (%)", round((mite.spe.ca$CA$eig[2]/sum(mite.spe.ca$CA$eig))*100,2)))
points(scores(mite.spe.ca, display="sites", choices=c(1,2), scaling=1),
       pch=21, col="black", bg="steelblue", cex=1.2)
text(scores(mite.spe.ca, display="species", choices=c(1), scaling=1),
     scores(mite.spe.ca, display="species", choices=c(2), scaling=1),
     labels=rownames(scores(mite.spe.ca, display="species", scaling=1)),
     col="red", cex=0.8)
```

And your resulting biplot likely looks something like this:
