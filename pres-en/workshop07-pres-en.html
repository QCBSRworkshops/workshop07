# Group discussion ![:cube]()

**Do we expect an increase in trophic position with length in the exact same way for : **
* all species?
* all lakes?

&lt;br&gt;

**How might these relationships differ?**


---
# Why choose mixed models?

### Ecological and biological data can be complex!

* Hierarchical structure in the data

* Many covariates and grouping factors

* Unbalanced study/experimental design

exclude: true
# 1. Why choose mixed models?

Ecological and biological data can be complex!

* Inherent structure to data

* Many covariates and grouping factors

* Small sample size

???

Note: _MFF: Not sure that mixed models help when the sample size is small. Also, I think that saying the data has a hierarchical structure makes more sense in the context of mixed models_


---
# Why choose mixed models?

### How could we analyze this data?

--

&lt;br&gt;

**Option 1. Separate**

- Run separate analyses for each species in each lake

&lt;br&gt;

**Option 2. Lump**

- Run one analysis ignoring lake and species


---
# Why choose mixed models?

.pull-left[![](images/fig_5_w5.png) ]

.pull-right[
**Option 1. Separate**

We could run separate analyses for each species :

* Estimate 6 intercepts and 6 slopes for each species (i.e. 6 lakes)

* Sample size *n* = 10 for each analysis (i.e. 10 fish/species/lake)

* Low chance of detecting an effect due to small *n*
]


---
# Why choose mixed models?

.pull-left[![](images/fig_6_w5.png)]

.pull-right[
**Option 2. Lump**
* Big sample size!

* What about pseudoreplication? (fish within a lake and within a species might be correlated)

* A lot of noise in the data! Some of it might be due to **differences** among **species** and **lakes**
]

---
# Why choose mixed models?

For **our question**, we only want to know if there is a **general effect of body length on the trophic position**.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

However :

* **this relationship might differ** slightly among **species** due to unmeasured biological processes (e.g. growth rate) or among **lakes** due to unmeasured environmental variables

* We need to **control** for these potential effects

--

&lt;br&gt;

LMMs enable us to **lump and separate the analysis**. They :

1. Estimate slope and intercept parameters for each species and lake (**separating**) but estimate fewer parameters than classical regression.

2. Use all the data available (**lumping**) while accounting for pseudoreplication by controlling for differences among lakes and species.


---
# Why choose mixed models?

### Fixed vs Random Effects

We frequently encounter the terms 'fixed' and 'random' effects in the LMM literature.

There are many possible ways to introduce them and we chose to present those we think are easier to apply when doing your analyses.


---
# Why choose mixed models?

### Fixed effects : deterministic processes

Data comes from : 
* all possible levels of a factor (**qualitative variable**)
* a predictor (**quantitative variable**)

&lt;br&gt;

We wish to make conclusions about the levels of the factor or about the relationship between the response variable and the predictor.


---
# Why choose mixed models?

### Random effects : stochastic processes

* Only **qualitative variables** = random factor

* Data includes only a random sample of all possible factor levels, all of interest

* Enable us to structure the error process


---
# Why choose mixed models?

### How do LMMs work?
&lt;br&gt;

**A.** Intercepts and/or slopes are allowed to vary according to a given factor (**random effect**) (e.g. by lake and/or species)

&lt;br&gt;

**B.** Intercepts, slopes and their confidence intervals are adjusted to **take the data structure into account**


---
# Random effects : enabling differences in intercepts and/or slopes among grouping levels

.pull-left[![](images/fig_7_w5.png)]
.pull-right[![](images/fig_9_w5.png)]
&lt;br&gt;

* It is assumed that the intercepts/slopes come from a normal distribution
* The model estimates a general intercept and/or slope with a standard deviation for each random effect (i.e. the normal distribution)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This avoids estimating an intercept and a slope for each species (+2 parameters per species) = **saves degrees of freedom** (less parameter estimation is needed)


---
# Random intercept

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style="float: right; width:50%;margin: 1%" src="images/fig_7_w5.png"&gt;

It is assumed that the intercepts come from a normal distribution

Only need to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution instead of 3 intercepts, i.e. one for each species&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

.comment[Note that the more levels your factor has, the more accurately the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution will be estimated. Three levels may be a little low, but easier to visualize!]

---
# Random intercept

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style="float: right; width:50%;margin: 1%" src="images/fig_8_w5.png"&gt;
Same principle for lakes

Estimate 2 parameters (mean and standard deviation) instead of 6 intercepts.

This saves degrees of freedom (less parameter estimation is needed)
&lt;/p&gt;


---
# Random slope


&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style="float: right; width:50%;margin: 1%" src="images/fig_9_w5.png"&gt;
The same principle applies to slopes that vary according to a given factor, just more difficult to visualize

As for intercepts, only the mean and standard deviation of the slopes are estimated instead of three distinct slopes.
&lt;/p&gt;


---
# Taking the data structure into account
&lt;br&gt;
**What happens if the sample size for a specific factor level is small? (e.g. low `\(n\)` for a specific species)**

If a certain species or lake is poorly represented in the data, the model will give more weight to the pooled model to estimate the intercept and/or slope of that species or lake (i.e. shrinkage).

Ideally, you should have a minimum of `\(n\)`=3 for any specific factor level.

.center[![:scale 50%](images/fig_12_w5.png) ]


---
# Taking the data structure into account
&lt;br&gt;
**How to assess the impact of a random effect on the model?**

* The confidence intervals for the **general** intercepts and slopes are adjusted to account for pseudo-replication based on the **intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)**

* The ICC describes the proportion of variance in the response variable that is attributed to a specific random effect :

`$$ICC = \frac{\sigma_{\alpha}^2}{\sigma_{\alpha}^2 + \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2}$$`

The ICC is calculated as the **ratio** of variance between the random effect (ex. ordonnées à l'origine des espèces) and the total variance.

Thus, the ICC informs us of the **extent** to which the average trophic position (i.e. intercepts) **varies** among species or lakes.

Note: _Tell the audience that mathematical notations may vary according to the article/book and according to how the model equation was written._

# How to implement mixed models in R?

&lt;img style="float: right; width:40%;margin: 1%" src="images/lego.jpg"&gt;

###### **Step 1.** *A priori* model building and data exploration

&lt;br&gt;

**Step 2.** Code potential models and model selection

&lt;br&gt;

**Step 3.** Model validation

&lt;br&gt;

**Step 4.** Model interpretation and visualization

---
# Step 1. *A priori* model building

**What we know *a priori*:**

* We want to determine if the trophic position can be predicted by body length, while taking into account the variation between species and lakes

* So we want a model that looks like this:

`$$PT_{ijk} \sim Length_i + Lake_j + Species_k + \epsilon_{ijk}$$`

---
# Step 1. Data exploration

**Does the data have the right structure?**


```r
fish.data &lt;- read.csv('data/qcbs_w7_data.csv')
str(fish.data)
# 'data.frame':	180 obs. of  4 variables:
#  $ Lake        : chr  "L1" "L1" "L1" "L1" ...
#  $ Fish_Species: chr  "S1" "S1" "S1" "S1" ...
#  $ Fish_Length : num  105 195 294 414 237 ...
#  $ Trophic_Pos : num  2.6 2.7 2.74 2.74 2.79 ...
```

It is recommended to clean up your working space (`rm.list()`) before building a model.

---
# Step 1. Data exploration

**Look at the distribution of samples for each factor:**


```r
table(fish.data[ , c("Lake", "Fish_Species")])
#     Fish_Species
# Lake S1 S2 S3
#   L1 10 10 10
#   L2 10 10 10
#   L3 10 10 10
#   L4 10 10 10
#   L5 10 10 10
#   L6 10 10 10
```

This dataset is perfectly balanced, but **mixed models can be used to analyze unbalanced experimental plans**, as it is often the case in ecology!

---
# Step 1. Data exploration

**Look at the distribution of continuous variables:**


```r
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
hist(fish.data$Fish_Length, xlab = "Length (mm)", main = "")
hist(fish.data$Trophic_Pos, xlab = "Trophic position", main = "")
```

&lt;img src="workshop07-pres-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Major deviations could cause heteroscedasticity problems. If necessary, make transformations. In this case, **the data seems OK**.

---
# Step 1. Data exploration

**Check for collinearity between your explanatory variables**

The problem with collinear predictors is simply that they explain the same thing, so their effect on the response variable will be confounded in the model.

In this example, there is no risk of collinearity with only one continuous variable. If you had another continuous variable (`Var2`), one simple way to check for collinearity is:


```r
plot(fish.data)

cor(var1, var2)
```

Here an [example of collinearity](https://yetanotheriteration.netlify.app/2018/01/high-collinearity-effect-in-regressions/).

---
# Challenge 3 ![:cube]()

What additional measures could we have taken in the field that could have been strongly correlated with body length?

--

&gt; An example is fish body mass - this variable is strongly correlated with fish length. Therefore, we do not want to include these two variables in the same model.


---
# Step 1. Data exploration

**Consider the scale of your data**

* If two variables in the same model have very different scales, the mixed model will likely return a `convergence error` when trying to compute the parameters.

* The &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cote_Z_(statistiques)"&gt;Z-correction&lt;/a&gt; standardizes the variables and solve this problem (function `scale()` in `R`):

`$$z = \frac{x-mean(x)}{standard.deviation(x)}$$`
---
# Step 1.  Data exploration

**Consider the scale of your data**

* Body length ![:faic](arrow-right) Long scale

* Trophic position ![:faic](arrow-right) Short scale

---
# Step 1.  Data exploration

**Consider the scale of your data**

Because our data have very different scales of variation, we apply the **Z-correction**


```r
# Standardized length, "by hand"
fish.data$Z_Length &lt;- (fish.data$Fish_Length - mean(fish.data$Fish_Length)) / 
                      sd(fish.data$Fish_Length)

# Standardized trophic position, with the function scale
fish.data$Z_TP     &lt;- scale(fish.data$Trophic_Pos)
```

---
# Step 1.  Data exploration

To find out if a mixed model is needed for your data, you need to determine whether it is important to consider the random effects that might influence the relationship you are interested in (in our case, lake and species)

**We can do it by :**

1. Creating a linear model without random effect

2. Calculating the residuals of this linear model

3. Plot the residuals against the levels of the potential random factors

---
# Step 1. Data exploration

Create a linear model without random effects

```r
lm.test &lt;- lm(Z_TP ~ Z_Length, data = fish.data)
```

Calculate residuals of this linear model

```r
lm.test.resid &lt;- rstandard(lm.test)
```

---
# Step 1. Data exploration

Plot the residuals against the levels of the potential random factors


```r
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

plot(lm.test.resid ~ as.factor(fish.data$Fish_Species),
     xlab = "Species", ylab = "Standardized residuals")

abline(0, 0, lty = 2)

plot(lm.test.resid ~ as.factor(fish.data$Lake),
     xlab = "Lake", ylab = "Standardized residuals")

abline(0, 0, lty = 2)
```

---
# Step 1. Data exploration

Plot the residuals against the levels of the potential random factors

&lt;img src="workshop07-pres-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.alert[These patterns suggest that there is residual variance that could be explained by these factors, so they should be included in the model.]

* `(1 | Lake)` ![:faic](arrow-right) indicate varying intercepts among lakes
* `REML = TRUE` ![:faic](arrow-right) estimation method

---
# Note on estimation methods

REML (*Restricted Maximum Likelihood*) is the default method in `lmer` (see `?lmer`).

The *Maximum Likelihood* (ML) method underestimate model variances by a factor of `\((n-k)/n\)`, where `\(k\)` is the number of fixed effects. 

The REML method corrects for this bias.

See this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/maximum-likelihood-ml-vs-reml-78cf79bef2cf) for more information on the difference between ML and REML. 

---
# Note on estimation methods

**Remember that you should use :** 

* **REML** to compare models with **nested random effects** and the same fixed effect structure

* **ML** to compare models with **nested fixed effects** and the same random effect structure

* **ML** to compare models **with and without random effects**

---
# Step 2. Code potential models

**What if we want the slopes to vary?**

.center[
![](images/fig_22_w5.png)
]

---
# Step 2. Code potential models

**Different structures for the model :**

- `(1 | Lake)` random effect by lake at the intrecept
- `(1 + Z_Length | Lake)` random effect by lake at the intercept and slope in response to the body length (NB: (`Z_Length | Lake)` gives the same random structure)
- `(-1 + Z_Length | Lake)` to have only the random effect at the slope
- `(1 | Lake) + (1 | Species)`  for crossed random effects
- `(1 | Lake:Fish_Species)` for the interaction between 2 random effects

- If your dataset includes nested random effects, you could use `/` to specify them, e.g. `(1 | factor1 / factor2)` if `factor2` is nested in `factor1` ([see ![:faic](stack-exchange)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/228800/crossed-vs-nested-random-effects-how-do-they-differ-and-how-are-they-specified))

# Step 2. Model selection

* To determine if you have built the best mixed model based on your prior knowledge, you should compare this *a priori* model to other alternative models.

* With the dataset you are working on, there are several alternative models that might better fit your data.

---
# Challenge 5 ![:cube]()

Make a list of 7 alternative models that could be compared to this one:


```r
lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 | Lake) + (1 | Fish_Species),
     data = fish.data, REML = TRUE)
```

.comment[Note: If we had different fixed effects between the models or a model without random effects, we would have to specify `REML = FALSE` to compare with likelihood methods like AIC.]

---
# Solution ![:cube]()

We first will also build the **basic linear model** `lm()` because it is always useful to see the variation in the AICc values.


```r
M0 &lt;- lm(Z_TP ~ Z_Length, data = fish.data)
```

However, to compare this model to the LMMs, it is important to .alert[change the estimation method to ML (`REML=FALSE`)] because `lm()` does not use the same estimation method as `lmer()`.

---
# Solution ![:cube]()


```r
# Linear model with no random effects
M0 &lt;- lm(Z_TP ~ Z_Length, data = fish.data)
# Full model with varying intercepts
M1 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 | Fish_Species) + (1 | Lake), 
           data = fish.data, REML = FALSE)
# Full model with varying intercepts and slopes
M2 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 + Z_Length | Fish_Species) + (1 + Z_Length | Lake),
           data = fish.data, REML = FALSE)
# No Lake, varying intercepts only
M3 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 | Fish_Species), data = fish.data, REML = FALSE)
# No Species, varying intercepts only
M4 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 | Lake), data = fish.data, REML = FALSE)

           data = fish.data, REML = FALSE)
# Full model with varying intercepts and slopes only varying by species
M8 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 + Z_Length | Fish_Species) + (1 | Lake),
           data = fish.data, REML = FALSE)
```

# Solution ![:cube]()

When fitting LMMs with `lmer()`, you may encounter some errors or warnings such as: 

* `boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular`, see [this discussion ![:faic](stack-exchange)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/378939/dealing-with-singular-fit-in-mixed-models)

* `Model failed to converge with max|grad| ...`, see [this discussion ![:faic](stack-exchange)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/242109/model-failed-to-converge-warning-in-lmer)

Here a [list](https://rdrr.io/cran/lme4/man/troubleshooting.html) of possible problems and how to troubleshoot them.

---
# Step 2. Model selection

* Now that we have a list of potential models, we want to compare them to each other to select the one(s) with the highest predictive power given the data.

* Models can be compared by using the `AICc` function from the` MuMIn` package.

* The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a **measure of model quality** that can be used to compare models.

* `AICc` corrects for bias created by small sample sizes.

---
# Step 2. Model selection

To find the AICc value of a model, use:


```r
library(MuMIn)
MuMIn::AICc(M1)
# [1] 77.30499
```

---
# Step 2. Model selection

To group all AICc values into a single table, use:

```r
AIC.table  &lt;- MuMIn::model.sel(M0, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8)
(AIC.table &lt;- AIC.table[ , c("df", "logLik", "AICc", "delta")])
#    df      logLik      AICc      delta
# M8  7   -8.597929  31.84702   0.000000
# M2  9   -8.216019  35.49086   3.643839
# M1  5  -33.480080  77.30499  45.457965
# M7  7  -33.186374  81.02391  49.176890
# M5  6 -128.310995 269.10754 237.260517
# M3  4 -134.532965 277.29450 245.447480
# M4  4 -224.715763 457.66010 425.813076
# M6  6 -224.671201 461.82795 429.980930
# M0  3 -236.861362 479.85909 448.012065
```

* `df` is the degree of freedom
* `logLik` is the loglikelihood
* `delta` is the AICc difference with the lowest value

We only displayed part of the results returned by the function `model.sel()`, see `?model.sel` for more information.

---
# Step 2. Model selection

What do these AICc values mean?


```r
AIC.table 
#    df      logLik      AICc      delta
# M8  7   -8.597929  31.84702   0.000000
# M2  9   -8.216019  35.49086   3.643839
# M1  5  -33.480080  77.30499  45.457965
# M7  7  -33.186374  81.02391  49.176890
# M5  6 -128.310995 269.10754 237.260517
# M3  4 -134.532965 277.29450 245.447480
# M4  4 -224.715763 457.66010 425.813076

# M0  3 -236.861362 479.85909 448.012065
```

* The model with the smallest AICc has the highest predictive power.

* Some suggest that if models are within 2 AICc units of each other then they are equally plausible.

* Let's take a closer look at M8 and M2. We can exclude other model because they have such higher AICc.

---
# Step 2. Model selection


```r
M8 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 + Z_Length | Fish_Species) + (1 | Lake),
           data = fish.data, REML = TRUE)

M2 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 + Z_Length | Fish_Species) + (1 + Z_Length | Lake),
           data = fish.data, REML = TRUE)

MuMIn::model.sel(M2,M8)[ , c("df", "logLik", "AICc", "delta")]
#    df    logLik     AICc    delta
# M8  7 -10.84011 36.33137 0.000000
# M2  9 -10.28932 39.63747 3.306098
```

Model `M8` seems to be the best among all models that we tested.

Note that we use now REML (i.e. `REML = TRUE`) as we are comparing two models with nested random effects and the same fixed effect structure.

---
# Step 2. Model selection

What is the structure of the best model?


```r
M8 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 + Z_Length | Fish_Species) + (1 | Lake),
           data = data, REML = FALSE)
```

Both the intercepts and slopes of the relationship between trophic position and length may vary by fish species, but only the intercepts may vary by lake.

.pull-left[![](images/fig_9_w5.png)]
.pull-right[![](images/fig_8_w5.png)]

---
# Step 2. Model selection

Once the best model is selected, the estimation method must be reset to `REML = TRUE`.


```r
M8 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 + Z_Length | Fish_Species) + (1 | Lake),
           data = fish.data, REML = TRUE)
```

---

# Challenge 6 ![:cube]()

Take 2 minutes with your neighbour to draw out the model structure of M2.

Biologically, how does it differ from M8?

Why is it not surprising that it's AICc value was 2nd best?


```r
M8 &lt;- lmer(Z_TP ~ Z_Length + (1 + Z_Length | Fish_Species) + (1 | Lake),
           data = fish.data, REML = TRUE)

.alert[M2] The trophic position is a function of length and both the intercept and the effect of length on trophic position can vary by fish species and lake.

  * .small[the intrinsic factors of species and lakes cause the relationship between trophic position and length to differ (i.e. both slopes and intercepts) (i.e. slopes and intercepts)]


.alert[M8] The trophic position is a function of length and both the intercept and the effect of length on trophic position can vary by fish species but only the intercept can vary by lake (not the slope of trophic position on length).

  * .small[intrinsic factors of species alone cause this relationship to differ (i.e. slopes) and that on average trophic positions might be higher or lower in one lake versus another (i.e. intercepts).]

**3.2 Check the independence of the model residuals with each covariate**

- Plot residuals vs each covariate not included in the model

  - If you observe patterns in these plots, you will know that there is variation in your dataset that could be explained by these covariates. You should consider including them in your model.

  - Because we have included all the measured variables in our model, we can not do this step.

This statistics could be used as it is. You could also calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) with this equation:

If the 95% confidence interval of the slope ($slope ± SE * 1.96$) includes zero, the slope (here = 0.4223), and therefore the effect of length on trophic position, is not significantly different from zero at the threshold `\(\alpha\)` = 0.05.

1. What is the slope and confidence interval of the Z_Length variable in the M8 model?

2. Is the slope of Z_Length significantly different from 0?

---
# Solution ![:cube]()

1. What is the slope and confidence interval of the Z_Length variable in the M8 model?

  - slope = 0.422;

  - CI upper limit = 0.4223 + 0.09*1.96 = 0.5987

  - CI lower limit = 0.4223 - 0.09*1.96 = 0.2459

2. Is the slope of Z_Length significantly different from 0?

  - Yes, because the CI [0.2459, 0.5987] does not include 0

**Review of LMM Workshop**:

- Structure in the dataset or correlation among observations can result in **lack of independence among observations** sampled from same sites or time points
- Account for this by including r**andom effect terms**

**Random effects**:

- Parameter is a sample from the population, i.e. the subjects you happen to be working with
- Explains the variance of the response variable

**Fixed effects**:

- Parameter is reproducible, i.e. would be the same across studies
- Explain the mean of the response variable

# Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs)

**Extension of GLMs to account for additional structure in dataset**

Follows similar steps introduced in LMM Workshop :

**1.** Incorporate random effects (like LMMs)

**2.** Handle non-normal data (letting errors take on different distribution families - e.g. Poisson or negative binomial) (like GLMs)

# Implementing GLMMs in R

Import the `Arabidopsis` dataset `banta_totalfruits.csv` into `R`.



```r
dat.tf &lt;- read.csv("banta_totalfruits.csv")
```
```r
# popu factor with a level for each population
# gen factor with a level for each genotype
# nutrient factor with levels for low (value = 1) or high (value = 8)
# amd factor with levels for no damage or simulated herbivory
# total.fruits integer indicating the number of fruits per plant
```

The effect of nutrient availability and herbivory (**fixed effects**) on the fruit production (**response variable**) of Arabidopsis thaliana was evaluated by measuring 625 plants across 9 different populations, each comprised of 2 to 3 different genotypes (**random effects**)


---
# Choosing an error distribution

The response variable is count data which suggests we need a **Poisson distribution** (i.e. the variance is equal to the mean)

&lt;img src="workshop07-pres-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

However, as we will soon see, the variance increases with the mean much more rapidly than expected under the Poisson distribution...


---
# Exploring variance

To illustrate heterogeneity in variance we will first create boxplots of the **log** of total fruit production (**response variable**) versus different environmental factors.

Let's create new variables that represent every combination of **nutrient** x **clipping** x **random factor**


```r
dat.tf &lt;- within(dat.tf,
{
  # genotype x nutrient x clipping
  gna &lt;- interaction(gen,nutrient,amd)
  gna &lt;- reorder(gna, total.fruits, mean)
  # population x nutrient x clipping
  pna &lt;- interaction(popu,nutrient,amd)
  pna &lt;- reorder(pna, total.fruits, mean)
})
```


---
# Exploring variance

.small[

```r
# Boxplot of total fruits vs genotype x nutrient x clipping interaction
ggplot(data = dat.tf, aes(factor(x = gna), y = log(total.fruits + 1))) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "skyblue2", outlier.shape = 21,
  outlier.colour = "skyblue2") +
  ylab("log (Total fruits)\n") + # \n creates a space after the title
  xlab("\nGenotype x nutrient x clipping") + # space before the title
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", colour = "red")
```

&lt;img src="workshop07-pres-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.comment[Similarly, the variance of total fruits shows a large amount of heterogeneity among populations (population x nutrient x clipping interaction).]


---
# Choosing error distribution

As we just saw, there is a large amount of heterogeneity among group variances even when the response variable is transformed (i.e. log).

If we plot the **group variances vs group means** (genotype x nutrient x clipping grouping), we can appreciate that the Poisson family is the least appropriate distribution (i.e. variances increase much faster than the means).

&lt;img src="workshop07-pres-en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Poisson GLMM

**Given the mean-variance relationship, we will most likely need a model with overdispersion.**

To understand why, let's start with a Poisson model.

--

To run a GLMM in `R` we will use the `glmer()` function from the `lme4` package :


```r
library(lme4)
mp1 &lt;- glmer(total.fruits ~ nutrient*amd + rack + status +
             (1|popu)+
             (1|gen),
             data = dat.tf, family = "poisson")
```

**Random effects**: `(1|popu)` and `(1|gen)`. We model random intercepts for both factors so that total fruit production can vary among populations (`popu`) and genotypes (`gen`).


---
# Overdispersion check

We can check for overdispersion using the `overdisp_fun()` function (Bolker *et al*. 2011) which divides the Pearson residuals by the residual degrees of freedom. 

The function tests whether **the ratio is greater than 1**.

--

Let's run the test :

```r
# Download the glmm_funs.R code from the wiki page and source it to run the function
source(file = "data/glmm_funs.R")
# Overdispersion?
overdisp_fun(mp1)
#       chisq       ratio           p        logp 
# 15755.86829    25.57771     0.00000 -6578.47025
```
--
.alert[Ratio is significantly &gt; 1]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As expected, we need to model a **different distribution** where the variance increases more rapidly than the mean.


---
# Negative binomial GLMM .small[(Poisson-gamma)]

**Option 1.** Recall that the **negative binomial** (or Poisson-gamma) distribution meets the assumption that the variance is proportional to the square of the mean

&lt;br&gt;
--
We model this distribution using the function `glmer.nb()` :

```r
mnb1 &lt;- glmer.nb(total.fruits ~ nutrient*amd + rack + status +
                 (1|popu)+
                 (1|gen),
                 data = dat.tf,
                 control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"))
# Control argument specifies the way we optimize the parameter values
```

--
We test again for overdispersion :

```r
# Overdispersion?
overdisp_fun(mnb1)
#         chisq         ratio             p          logp 
# 721.034466390   1.170510497   0.002143424  -6.145350714
```

.alert[Ratio is now much closer to 1 although p &lt; 0.05]


---
# Poisson-lognormal GLMM

**Option 2.** The **Poisson-lognormal** distribution
&lt;br&gt;

This can be achieved simply by placing an **observation-level random effect** in the model formula.

See Harrison (2014) for further details https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.616.

&lt;br&gt;
--
To do so, we first create a variable named `X` :

```r
# This variable is already in your data "dat.tf", but here is how we create it :
dat.tf$X &lt;- 1:nrow(dat.tf)
```


We take overdispersion into account by adding the random effect `(1|X)` in the formula :

```r
mpl1 &lt;- glmer(total.fruits ~ nutrient*amd + rack + status +
              (1|X) +
              (1|popu)+
              (1|gen),
data = dat.tf, family = "poisson",
control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"))
```


---
# Poisson-lognormal GLMM
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Finally, we test for overdispersion :

```r
overdisp_fun(mpl1)
#         chisq         ratio             p          logp 
#  1.775360e+02  2.886764e-01  1.000000e+00 -3.754681e-73
```

.alert[Ratio now meets our criterion, thus, &lt; 1]

# Poisson-lognormal GLMM

# Poisson-lognormal GLMM

**Let's visualize the random effects**

You can extract the random effect predictions using `ranef()` and plot them using a `dotplot()` from the `lattice` package.

&lt;br&gt;

We observe differences **among population** :

- Spanish populations (SP) have larger values than Swedish (SW) or Dutch (NL) populations

- Difference among genotypes largely driven by genotype 34

           layout.heights = list(top.padding = 0, bottom.padding = 0))

---
# Model selection

The same methods can be used with a glmm or lmm to choose between models with various random intercepts and/or random slopes and to choose fixed effects to keep in final model.

&lt;br&gt;

Here are two approaches :

- an **information theoretic approach** (e.g., AICc - Workshop 5)
- a **frequentist approach** (where the significance of each term is evaluated using a likelihood ratio test; LRT, with the `anova()` function)


---
# Model selection

We first code potential models and compare them using AICc.comment[*]:


```r
mpl2 &lt;- update(mpl1, . ~ . - rack) # model without rack
mpl3 &lt;- update(mpl1, . ~ . - status) # model without status
mpl4 &lt;- update(mpl1, . ~ . - amd:nutrient) # without amd:nutrient interaction

aic_tab  &lt;- MuMIn::model.sel(mpl1, mpl2, mpl3, mpl4)
(round(aic_table &lt;- aic_tab[ , c("AICc", "delta", "df")], digits = 2))
#         AICc delta df
# mpl1 5015.73  0.00 10
# mpl4 5017.11  1.38  9
# mpl3 5017.22  1.49  8
# mpl2 5070.75 55.02  9
```

.comment[*NB: We do not cover all possible models above, however, the interaction `amd:nutrient` can only be evaluated if both amd and nutrient (i.e., the main effects) are included in the model.
]


---
# Model selection

Alternatively, we can use `drop1()` and `dfun()` functions to evaluate our fixed effects (`dfun()` converts the AIC values returned by the `drop1()` into `\(\Delta\)`AIC values)

.small[

```r
dd_LRT &lt;- drop1(mpl1, test = "Chisq")
(dd_AIC &lt;- dfun(drop1(mpl1)))
# Single term deletions
# 
# Model:
# total.fruits ~ nutrient * amd + rack + status + (1 | X) + (1 | 
#     popu) + (1 | gen)
#              npar   dAIC
# &lt;none&gt;             0.000
# rack            1 55.083
# status          2  1.612
# nutrient:amd    1  1.444
```
]

--

- Strong **rack** effect (dAIC = 55.08 if we remove this variable)
- Effects of **status** and **interaction** term are weak (dAIC &lt; 2)


---
# Model selection
Let's start by **removing the non-significant interaction** term to test main effects of nutrient and clipping

```r
mpl2 &lt;- update(mpl1, . ~ . - amd:nutrient)

mpl3 &lt;- update(mpl2, . ~ . - rack) # pas de rack ou d'interaction
mpl4 &lt;- update(mpl2, . ~ . - status) # pas de status ou d'interaction
mpl5 &lt;- update(mpl2, . ~ . - nutrient) # pas de nutrient ou d'interaction
mpl6 &lt;- update(mpl2, . ~ . - amd) # pas d'herbivorie ou d'interaction
```

---
# Model selection
**What are our conclusions ?**
&lt;br&gt;

Both the main effects of **nutrient** and **clipping** are strong (large change in AIC of `\(135.6\)` (`mpl5`) and `\(10.2\)` (`mpl6`) if either nutrient or clipping are dropped, respectively).

&lt;br&gt;

**Our final model includes :**

Fixed effects
* nutrients
* clipping
* rack

Random effects
* observation-level random effect `(1|X)` 
* populations `(1|popu)` 
* genotypes `(1|gen)`
